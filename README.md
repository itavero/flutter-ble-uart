# flutter_ble_uart
Package to easily integrate UART over Bluetooth Low Energy into your Flutter app.

For more information about the UART Service and compatible devices, I recommend visiting the [Adafruit website](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-the-adafruit-bluefruit-le-uart-friend/uart-service).

## Getting Started
For help getting started with Flutter, view our online [documentation](https://flutter.io/).
For help on editing package code, view the [documentation](https://flutter.io/developing-packages/).

Since this package is not yet published anywhere (other than GitHub), you can add it to your `pubspec.yaml` like this:
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_ble_uart:
      git: git@github.com:itavero/flutter-ble-uart.git
```

**TODO**: Write a tutorial and/or example app.

## Current state
This is still very much a *work in progress*. It is definitely *not* production ready.

It works.. most of the time.. if you are lucky. 😅
